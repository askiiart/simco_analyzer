### Ben's Sim Companies Analyzer

This is a tool I'm programming for Sim Companies which will automatically find an optimal layout for your map.

This tool cannot yet analyze qualities of a product, only the lowest priced quality on the exchange, but I'm planning on
adding support for qualities later.

Note: This tool will not be able to analyze restaurants. Not ever. That's the only theoretical limitation though, that 
and computing power.
